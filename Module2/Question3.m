%----- YOUR CODE GOES BELOW HERE -----

function dtransform = distanceTransform(map, goal)
    % Input:
    %   map is an arbitrary size real matrix representing an occupancy grid. The elements are equal to 0 (free space) or 1 (occupied)
    %   goal is a 1x2 matrix containing the end coordinate [x y] for the path
    % Return:
    %   dtransform is a matrix, the same size as map, whose elements reflect the distance from that cell to the goal
    
    % compute the distance transform of map
    dtransform =
end

function path = findPath(map, start, goal)
    % Input:
    %   map is an arbitrary size real matrix representing an occupancy grid. The elements are equal to 0 (free space) or 1 (occupied)
    %   start is a 1x2 matrix containing the start coordinate [x y] for the path
    %   goal is a 1x2 matrix containing the end coordinate [x y] for the path
    % Return:
    %   path is an Nx2 matrix containing the ordered path from start to goal, inclusive of end points.  N depends on the map.
    
    dtransform = distanceTransform(map, goal);   % use your own distance transform function
    
    % compute the best path
